# Toward ethical, transparent and fair AI/ML: a critical reading list for engineers, designers, and policy makers


In the past 5 years there’s been a lot of enthusiasm about AI and specifically machine learning and deep learning. As we continuously deploy AI models in the wild we are forced to re-examine what are the effects of knowledge symbolisation, generalisation and classification on the historical, political and social conditions of human life. We also need to remind ourselves that algorithms don’t exercise their power over us. People do. 

This reading list is made for engineers, scientists, designers, policy makers and those interested in machine learning and AI. It’s an open ended document that examines machine learning as a sociotechnical system and contextualises its critical discourse. For suggestions and comments please tweet @irinimalliaraki or drop me an email at e.malliaraki16@imperial.ac.uk

These sections aren't in any particular order. There's overlap and interaction between these topics that you can jump around as much as you want; Reading "out of order" could lead to interesting connections.
